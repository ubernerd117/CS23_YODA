## A cross platform App for traversing the campus using pictures

This app has 3 "pages":

Location page: This is where you swipe through a bunch of pictures
                and double tap the picture that looks like the building that is 
                closest to you. This sets the origin point as that building.

                Then, from the drop down menu, pick the location you want the directions to.

Directions page: This is where you would find the direction in which you need to 
                 travel if you want to go to your selected building. 
                 The markers on the map also contain information about the nearby buildings.

Destination page: at any point if you want to check if you are going to the right
                  place, you can go to destination to check the location's facilites.
                  and it also serves as a visual queue to the user so they can
                  be sure that they are walking into the right building.
